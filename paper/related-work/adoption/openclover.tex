\subsection{OpenClover}
OpenClover\footnote{\url{https://openclover.org}} is a code coverage tool for Java and Groovy projects. It was created by Atlassian and open-sourced in 2017. OpenClover profiles itself as ``the most sophisticated code coverage tool'', by extracting useful metrics from the coverage results and by providing features that can optimise the test suite. These features include powerful integrations with development software and prominent Continuous Integration systems. Furthermore, OpenClover can automatically analyse the coverage results to detect relations between the application source code and the test cases. This feature allows OpenClover to predict which test cases will have been affected, given a set of modifications to the source code. Subsequently, we can interpret these predictions to implement \tcs{} and therefore reduce the test suite execution time.
