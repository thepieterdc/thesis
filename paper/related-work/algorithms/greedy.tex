\subsection{Greedy algorithm}
The first algorithm is a \emph{greedy} heuristic, which was originally designed to find an approximation for the set-covering problem \cite{evaluationoftestsuiteminimization}. A greedy algorithm always makes a locally optimal choice, assuming that this will eventually lead to a globally optimal solution \cite{10.5555/1614191}. Algorithm \ref{alg:tsm-greedy} presents the Greedy algorithm for \tsm{}. The greedy aspect in this algorithm is to always select the test case that contributes the most additional coverage.
