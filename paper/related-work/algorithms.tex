\section{Algorithms}
In \autoref{ssec:tsm} I have already mentioned that applying Test Suite Minimisation is essentially the same as finding the minimal hitting set of the test suite and the set of requirements, which is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, we require the use of heuristics that are already known to solve other, similar problems.
