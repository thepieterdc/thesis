\section{Continuous Integration}
\subsection{Agile Manifesto}
Since the late 1990's, developers have tried to reduce the time occupied by the implementation and testing phases. In order to accomplish this, several new implementations of the SDLC were proposed and evaluated, later collectively referred to as \emph{Agile development methodologies}. The term \emph{Agile development} was coined during a meeting of seventeen prominent software developers, held between February 11-13, 2001, in Snowbird, Utah \cite{jimhighsmith2001}. As a result of this meeting, the developers defined the four key values and twelve principles that define these new methodologies, called the \emph{Manifesto for Agile Software Development}, also known as the \emph{Agile Manifesto}.

\subsubsection{Four values}

The four key values of Agile programming should be interpreted as follows, according to the authors: "While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more" \cite{beck2001agile}. It should be noted that these values are merely guidelines and that no concrete implementation is provided. A variety of different programming models have arisen since 2001, each incorporating these values in their own unique way.

\subsection{The need for Agile}
Over the past decade, the agile methodologies have received increasing attention amongst software developers, following the world economic crisis of 2009 \cite{ionel2009}. A consequence of this crisis was that software companies were forced to cut on their expenses and find ways to reduce the \emph{time-to-market} of their applications.

- probleem met waterfall model -> een bron hiervoor?

- feedback loop

- buildup naar waarom tooling nodig is

- waarom

- wat

- voorbeelden: Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis-CI, recent GitHub Actions + screenshots

- Probleem en oplossingen met regression tests

  - Test Case Prioritization -> Focus want geen tests weggooien
  
  - Test Suite Minimization
  
  - Test Suite Selection
  
  - Test Suite Reduction
