\subsubsection{Travis CI}
The final Continuous Integration platform which I will discuss is Travis CI. This \CI{} system was launched in 2011 and can only be used in addition to an existing GitHub repository. Travis build tasks can be configured in a similar fashion as GitLab CI, but the builds can exclusively be executed on their servers. Besides running builds after a commit has been pushed to the repository, it is also possible to schedule daily, weekly or monthly builds using cron jobs. Similar to GitHub Actions, open-source projects can be built at zero cost and a paid plan exists for private repositories \cite{travisanalysis}. It is not possible to create custom plugins, however Travis CI already features built-in support for a variety of programming languages. In 2020, almost 1 million projects are being built using Travis CI \cite{travis2020}.
