\section{Test subjects}

\subsection{Dodona}
Dodona\footnote{\url{https://dodona.ugent.be/}} is an open source online learning environment created by Ghent University, allowing students from secondary schools and universities in Belgium and South-Korea to submit solutions to programming exercises and receive automated feedback. The application is built using the Ruby-on-Rails web framework. In order to automate the testing process of the application, Dodona makes use of Github Actions (\autoref{sssec:github-actions}) to run tests using the default \texttt{MiniTest} testing framework. The coverage of the test suite is being recorded by \texttt{SimpleCov}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov}}.
