\section{Design goals}
\velocity{} has been implemented with three design goals in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Extensibility:} It should be possible and straightforward to support additional \CI{} systems, programming languages and test frameworks. Subsequently, a clear interface should be provided to integrate additional prioritisation algorithms.
	
	\item \textbf{Language agnosticism:} This design goal is related to the framework being extensible. The implemented tools should not need to be aware of the programming language of the source code, nor the used test framework.
	
	\item \textbf{Self-improvement:} The prioritisation framework supports all of the algorithms presented in \autoref{sec:relatedwork-algorithms}. It is possible that the performance of a given algorithm is strongly dependent on the nature of the project it is being applied to. In order to facilitate this behaviour, the framework should be able to measure the performance of every algorithm and ``learn'' which algorithm offers the best prediction, given a set of source code.
\end{enumerate}
