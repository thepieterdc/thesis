\chapter{Related work}
In the previous chapter I have stressed the paramount importance of periodically integrating one's changes into the upstream repository. Additionally, Continuous Integration was introduced as both a practice and a tool to facilitate this often complex and time-consuming process. However, Continuous Integration is not the golden bullet for software engineering. In this chapter I will investigate the flip side of applying this practice. After every integration, all of the unit and regression tests in the test suite must be executed to ensure that the integration was successful and that no new bugs have been introduced. As the project evolves, the size of the codebase increases and consequently the amount of tests will increase as well in order to maintain a sufficiently high coverage level. An increase in the size of the test suite will inevitably lead to an increase in test duration \cite{evaluationoftestsuiteminimization}, which imposes an issue of scaling. Walcott, Soffa and Kapfhammer illustrate the magnitude of this problem by providing an example of a codebase consisting of 20.000 lines, for which the tests require up to seven weeks to complete \cite{10.1145/1146238.1146240}.\\

\noindent Fortunately, multiple developers and researchers have found some techniques that can help to resolve this issue. I will describe the existing methods in the below section and afterwards I will conclude this chapter by providing an overview of existing implementations in software of the discussed techniques.

\section{Classification of approaches}
In literature, three distinct approaches are currently known to handle the scalability issues of growing test suites. Developers can either apply \emph{\tsm{}}, \emph{\tcs{}} or \emph{\tcp{}} \cite{evaluationoftestsuiteminimization}. All three algorithms can be applied to any set of tests, however there is a trade-off to be made. Depending on which algorithm is chosen, it will have a major impact on the duration of the test suite duration in exchange for a reduced test coverage level. I will now elaborate on the details of these three approaches.
